//Command used to manage the RSS feeds linked in any Youtube channel

To create a RSS feed for a playlist, you need to know its ID number. You can find it at the end of its URL on YouTube when you visit it on the web. Example: this is the ID of the following playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e82VE8UtW8A&list=RDQMD9kjrzYV7ZI is RDQMD9kjrzYV7ZI

Now, to build the actual feed URL, you need to use the following format: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=YOURPLAYLISTIDHERE

By the end of the URL, you need to add the ID of your playlist and then add the entire URL to your RSS reader. It’s easy and also very simple, isn’t it?

This will depend entirely on your content management system. Many systems, like WordPress, are easy to do yourself.
